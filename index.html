  <td><strong>Text Description</strong></td>
  <td>I consider myself to be a hard-working, caring person. I like to work hard on my personal projects and put a lot of effort into them.
  In my personal life, I value family the most as they have been there for me since day 1. For that reason, I have big goals to make them proud and
  hopefully try and pay them back for what they've done.</td>

    <td><strong>Career Description</strong></td>
    <td>At the moment, im focusing on computer science. I hope I can study that to a professional level and possibly make a career out of it.
        I plan to go to university after high school and take Computing Science, at the same time practice a few languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        From there, I will begin to work on personal projects and try to apply for companies for an internship as a Frontend Web developer. This is what
        interests me mostly.</td>
