        <td>At the moment, im focusing on computer science. I hope I can study that to a professional level and possibly make a career out of it.
            I plan to go to university after high school and take Computing Science, at the same time practice a few languages such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
            From there, I will begin to work on personal projects and try to apply for companies for an internship as a Frontend Web developer. This is what
            interests me mostly.</td>
